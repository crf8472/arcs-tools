\brief Calculate AccurateRip checksums locally

\version @PROJECT_VERSION@



\section SYNOPSIS

@TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ [OPTIONS] AUDIOFILE1 AUDIOFILE2 ...


\section DESCRIPTION

Calculates AccurateRip checksums from losslessly encoded audiofiles and
TOC information and verifies them against reference checksums.

\copydoc inc_calcdesc

The reference checksums are mandatory. They either can be specified by the name
of a binary file (some dBAR-*.bin file) using \b -r or can be piped in via
stdin. Reference checksums can also be passed as a comma-separated list of
\b --refvalues that are parsed as hexadecimal numbers.


\section OPTIONS

\subsection INPUT Options for processing input

\par -r,--response=RESPONSEFILE
Specify the binary file with the AccurateRip response. Parsed text files will
not be accepted. If \b --response is absent, references are expected on stdin.

\par --refvalues=...,...
Comma-separated list of hexadecimal values (with or without leading base marker
'0x') that are treated as reference values for verification.

\par --no-first
Do not process the first of the audiofiles as first track of an album.
See also \b --no-last and \b --no-album.

\par --no-last
Do not process the last of the audiofiles as last track of an album.
See also \b --no-first and \b --no-album.

\par --no-album
Abbreviates \b --no-first \b --no-last to suppress calculating a first and a
last track. This switch is intended for cases in which only some tracks of an
album are to be verified.

\copydoc inc_calcinoptions


\subsection OUTPUT Options for output

\par --no-track-nos
Suppress output of track numbers.

\par --no-filenames
Suppress output of audio filenames.

\par --no-offsets
Suppress output of track offsets.

\par --no-lengths
Suppress output of track lengths.

\par --no-labels
Suppress output of any row labels and column titles.

\par --col-delim
Set the column delimiter for table output

\par --print-id
(NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) Print it AccurateRip id of the album to be verified.

\par --print-url
(NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) Print the AccurateRip URL of the album to be verified.

\par --print-all-matches
Print each match trial for each reference block regardless of the result. This
entails that one output table for each reference block will be printed, showing
the match results for ARCSv1 as well as ARCSv2 for this particular block. If
\b --refvalues is used, the effect is just to activate the output of the match
result for ARCSv1 as well as ARCSv2.

\par -b,--boolean
Return the difference of the best match. Hence, 0 indicates a successful
verification and some value bigger than 0 indicates that some input tracks
could not be verified. The result only informs whether some reference block
could be matched for either ARCSv1 or ARCSv2.

\par -n,--no-output
Do not print any result. Implies \b --boolean, therefore the return value will
be informative.

\section EXAMPLES

\subsection ALBUMTOCM 1. Album + TOC, using the audio files specified in the TOC

You have: An album ripped to a single audio file, say fLaC, or a set of files
and the TOC (as CUESheet). The CUESheet specifies the actual audiofiles, may it
be a single file or one file per track. You saved the checksums from AccurateRip
in a local dBAR file (see man 1 arcstk-parse).

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin -m myalbum/toc.cue



\subsection ALBUMTOCF 2. Album + TOC, overriding the files in the TOC, if any


\par a) Single audio file

You have: An album ripped to a single audio file, say fLaC, and the TOC as
CUESheet. The CUESheet specifies audio files, but you want to override them with
\c myalbum/album_rip.flac instead. You saved the checksums from AccurateRip in a
local dBAR file (see man 1 arcstk-parse).

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin -m myalbum/toc.cue myalbum/album_rip.flac


\par b) One audio file per track

You have: An album ripped one-file-per-track to a set of fLaC files, and the TOC
as a CUESheet. The CUESheet is stored elsewhere or references WAV files, so you
want to override its file references. You saved the checksums from AccurateRip
in a local dBAR file (see man 1 arcstk-parse).

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin -m myalbum/toc.cue myalbum/track_1.flac myalbum/track_2.flac ...



\subsection ALBUMFILES 3. Audiofiles forming an album, but no TOC

You have: A set of audio files that you know to form an album, but there is no
TOC information. The filenames are such that the first filename is also the
first track and the last filename is the last track of the album. You saved the
checksums from AccurateRip in a local dBAR file (see man 1 arcstk-parse).

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin --album myalbum/f1.flac myalbum/f2.flac ...


\subsection FILES 4. Some audiofiles but no TOC

You have: A set of audiofiles that do not form an album in the passed order,
e.g. the mapping from files to tracks is not known. You saved the checksums of
some possibly matching album from AccurateRip in a local dBAR file
(see man 1 arcstk-parse).

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin myalbum/track_1.flac myalbum/track_2.flac ...

If you know that \c track_1.flac is the first track, declare it accordingly:

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin --first myalbum/track_1.flac myalbum/track_2.flac ...

If you know that \c track_15.flac is the last track, declare it accordingly:

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin --last myalbum/track_1.flac ... myalbum/track_15.flac

\b NOTE The number of audiofiles passed must be equal to the track count of the
album.
