\brief Calculate AccurateRip checksums locally

\version @PROJECT_VERSION@



\section SYNOPSIS

@TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ [OPTIONS] AUDIOFILE1 AUDIOFILE2 ...


\section DESCRIPTION

Calculates AccurateRip checksums from losslessly encoded audiofiles and
TOC information and verifies them against reference checksums.

\copydoc inc_calcdesc

You have to pass either the reference as a binary file (some dBAR-*.bin file)
using \b -r or pipe this data in via stdin.


\section OPTIONS

\subsection INPUT Options for processing input

\copydoc inc_calcinoptions

\par -r, --response=RESPONSEFILE
Specify the binary file with the AccurateRip response. Parsed text files will
not be accepted.


\subsection OUTPUT Options for output

\copydoc inc_calcoutoptions

\copydoc inc_logfileopt

\copydoc inc_outfileopt

\copydoc inc_logoptions

\copydoc inc_versionopt


\section EXAMPLES

\subsection ALBUMTOCM 1. Album + TOC, using the audio files specified in the TOC

You have: An album ripped to a single audio file, say fLaC, or a set of files
and the TOC (as CUESheet). The CUESheet specifies the actual audiofiles, may it
be a single file or one file per track. You saved the checksums from AccurateRip
in a local dBAR file.

You want: To verify the ARCSs of each track.

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin -m foo/foo.cue

or

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -m foo/foo.cue < dBAR-some_id.bin


\subsection ALBUMTOCF 2. Album + TOC, overriding the files in the TOC, if any


\par a) Single audio file

You have: An album ripped to a single audio file, say fLaC, and the TOC as
CUESheet. The CUESheet specifies audio files, but you want to override them with
\c foo/foo.flac instead. You saved the checksums from AccurateRip in a local
dBAR file.

You want: To verify the ARCSs of each track.

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin -m foo/foo.cue foo/foo.flac

or

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -m foo/foo.cue foo/foo.flac < dBAR-some_id.bin


\par b) One audio file per track

You have: An album ripped one-file-per-track to a set of fLaC files, and the TOC
as a CUESheet. The CUESheet is stored elsewhere or references WAV files, so you
want to override its file references. You saved the checksums from AccurateRip
in a local dBAR file.

You want: To verify the ARCSs of each track/file.

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin -m foo/foo.cue foo/\*.flac


\subsection ALBUMFILES 3. Audiofiles forming an album, but no TOC

You have: A set of audio files that you know to form an album, but there is no
TOC information. The filenames are such that the first filename is also the
first track and the last filename is the last track of the album. You saved the
checksums from AccurateRip in a local dBAR file.

You want: To verify the ARCSs of each track/file.

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin --album foo/\*.flac

Of course you can specifiy the order of the filenames explicitly:

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin --album foo/f1.flac foo/f2.flac ...


\subsection FILES 4. Some audiofiles but no TOC

You have: A set of audiofiles that do not form an album in the passed order,
e.g. the mapping from files to tracks is not known. You saved the checksums of
some possibly matching album from AccurateRip in a local dBAR file.

You want: To verify the ARCSs of each file.

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin foo/\*.flac

Of course you can specifiy the order of the filenames explicitly:

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin foo/f1.flac foo/f2.flac ...

If you know that \c f1.flac is the first track, declare it accordingly:

$ @TOOL_NAME_VERIFY@ -r dBAR-some_id.bin --first foo/f1.flac foo/f2.flac ...

\b NOTE The number of audiofiles passed must be equal to the track count of the
album.
