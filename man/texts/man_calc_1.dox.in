\section EXAMPLES

\subsection ALBUMTOCM 1. Album + TOC, using the audio files specified in the TOC

You have: An album ripped to a single audio file, say fLaC, or a set of files
and the TOC (as CUESheet). The CUESheet specifies the actual audiofiles, may it
be a single file or one file per track.

You want: The ARCSs of each track.

$ @TOOL_NAME_CALC@ -m foo/foo.cue


\subsection ALBUMTOCF 2. Album + TOC, overriding the files in the TOC, if any


\par a) Single audio file

You have: An album ripped to a single audio file, say fLaC, and the TOC as
CUESheet. The CUESheet specifies audio files, but you want to override them with
\c foo/foo.flac instead.

You want: The ARCSs of each track.

$ @TOOL_NAME_CALC@ -m foo/foo.cue foo/foo.flac


\par b) One audio file per track

You have: An album ripped one-file-per-track to a set of fLaC files, and the TOC
as a CUESheet. The CUESheet is stored elsewhere or references WAV files, so you
want to override its file references.

You want: The ARCSs of each track/file.

$ @TOOL_NAME_CALC@ -m foo/foo.cue foo/\*.flac


\subsection ALBUMFILES 3. Audiofiles forming an album, but no TOC

You have: A set of audio files that you know to form an album, but there is no
TOC information. The filenames are such that the first filename is also the
first track and the last filename is the last track of the album.

You want: The ARCSs of each track/file.

$ @TOOL_NAME_CALC@ --album foo/\*.flac

Of course you can specifiy the order of the filenames explicitly:

$ @TOOL_NAME_CALC@ --album foo/f1.flac foo/f2.flac ...


\subsection FILES 4. Some audiofiles but no TOC

You have: A set of audiofiles that do not form an album. (Either the album is
missing the first or last track or the tracks are completely unrelated.)

You want: The ARCSs of each file.

$ @TOOL_NAME_CALC@ foo/\*.flac

Of course you can specifiy the order of the filenames explicitly:

$ @TOOL_NAME_CALC@ foo/f1.flac foo/f2.flac ...

If you know that \c f1.flac is the first track, declare it accordingly:

$ @TOOL_NAME_CALC@ --first foo/f1.flac foo/f2.flac ...
